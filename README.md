# count13

count13 is an app that lets you create notes with a counter and increment or decrement this count after your liking.
My plan for the app is using all the newest UI/UX principles from material.io, and expand the usual offline CRUD with Room to an online service with Firebase as a backend. Basically the app works offline and the user has the option to sign in with Facebook, Google or create an own account and take his or her notes and counts to multiple devices using this service.

The app is currently under pre-alpha development and will be available for download on the open testing track on Google Play shorly.
